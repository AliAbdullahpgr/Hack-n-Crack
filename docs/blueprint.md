# **App Name**: Hash & Crack

## Core Features:

- Hashing Playground: Allows users to input text and hash it using MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 algorithms.
- Rainbow Table Demo: Demonstrates rainbow table attacks on MD5 hashes using a precomputed table.
- Algorithm Comparison: Provides a visual comparison of MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 algorithms, highlighting their security levels.
- Salt Option: Allows users to add salt to the hashing process, improving security.
- Hash Cracking Tool: If MD5 is selected for hashing and a user's entered text exists in a Rainbow Table, then notify the user of a successful hash 'crack'.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to convey security and sophistication.
- Background color: Light lavender (#EDE7F6), a desaturated tint of the primary to set a light tone and aid readability.
- Accent color: Soft teal (#4DB6AC) for interactive elements, to guide the user through the process. 
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern and technical feel; body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for readability.
- Use lock and key icons to represent security, and algorithm-specific icons.
- Clearly separate the Hashing Playground and Rainbow Table Demo sections using tabs or distinct pages.
- Use subtle transitions and animations when hashing or cracking, to create a dynamic and engaging experience.
